# Codes for estimating the parameters of frailty models for repairable systems under imperfect repair

## The repository

This repository contains the codes implemented from the theory presented in Manuscript "Statistical modeling and reliability analysis of multiple repairable systems with dependent failure times under imperfect repair", as well as the databases used in that work.
